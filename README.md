Timestamp Microservices Project
===============================
This is part of Free Code Camps back end dev certification. I am using node.js and express for this project.


User Stories
------------


- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)

- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
